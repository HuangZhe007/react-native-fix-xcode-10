# react-native-fix-xcode-10

Fixes issues with compiling React Native 0.55.4 apps on XCode 10

# Usage

```
yarn add rhdeck/react-native-fix-xcode-10
open ios/*.xcodeproj
# run the project
# FAIL!
react-native fix-xcode
# run the project again
# SUCCESS!
```

Here's hoping this is only necessary for a few days.
